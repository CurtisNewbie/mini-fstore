# mini-fstore

Mini File Storage Engine ( Not really :D )

## Configuration

| Property              | Description                                    | Default Value |
| ---                   | ---                                            | ---           |
| fstore.storage.dir    | Storage Directory                              | ./storage     |
| fstore.trash.dir      | Trash Directory                                | ./trash       |
| fstore.pdelete.strategy | Strategy used to 'physically' delete files, there are two types of strategies available: direct / trash. When using 'direct' strategy, files are deleted directly. When using 'trash' strategy, files are moved into the trash directory. | trash|
| goauth.report.enabled | Whether goauth resource/path report is enabled | false         |
| fstore.migr.file-server.enabled | Enable file-server migration | false |
| fstore.migr.file-server.dry-run | Enable file-server migration dry-run mode, files are not copied, nothing really happens, it's used mainly for debugging and testing | true |
| fstore.migr.file-server.storage | Where the file-server's files are located. These files must be moved to mini-fstore's machine manually before the migration. | |
| fstore.migr.file-server.mysql.user | file-server's database connection username | |
| fstore.migr.file-server.mysql.password | file-server's database connection password | |
| fstore.migr.file-server.mysql.database | file-server's database connection schema name | |
| fstore.migr.file-server.mysql.host | file-server's database connection host | |
| fstore.migr.file-server.mysql.port | file-server's database connection port | |

<!-- | fstore.server.mode    | Server Mode. There are three kinds of server mode: `cluster`, `proxy`, and `node`. <br><br>In `cluster` mode, servers operate as a single cluster, if every one of them is connected to the same database and using the same disk, they will behave exactly the same. <br><br> But there will be cases where we need to deploy the servers on different machines using different disks. This is when we use `proxy` + `node` mode. The one with `proxy` mode will behave just like a proxy, and the servers with `node` mode will be responsible for storing the actual files. | cluster | -->

## Migration From File-Server

Migration only supports [File-Server > V1.2.7](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/file-server).

Before the migration, files uploaded to `File-Server` must be moved/copied to mini-fstore's machine manually, and the location of these files (the base folder) must be configured correctly in `fstore.migr.file-server.storage`.

Let's assume that the database `File-Server` connects to named `fileserver`, and the database `Mini-Fstore` connects to named `mini_fstore`.

When migration is enabled, mini-fstore attempts to connect to file-server's MySQL database. It checks whether the table `fileserver.file_info` has the column `fstore_file_id`. If not, an error is thrown, warning that the table `fileserver.file_info` is not compatible and it cannot be migrated.

If the validation is passed, `Mini-Fstore` will read the table `fileserver.file_info` to list all the files that are not deleted and do not have any `file_id` created in column `fstore_file_id`. These files are migrated one by one, by copying files from the `fstore.migr.file-server.storage` to `fstore.storage.dir`. A new `file_id` is generated by `Mini-Fstore`, and updated back to `fileserver.file_info`, and can be found in `mini_fstore.file` as well.
